# Roadmap/Future development
Features that could be added for better user experience: add functionality to the 'Recent Searches' link to allow user to click those list buttons to retrieve that movie. Create the same type of list and functionality to a 'Saved Movies' feature accesible in the nav bar. Add the carousel functionality to the 'hero' container.  Could capture and render more info from the TMDB API to include reviews or other notable data.
